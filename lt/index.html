<p>The LSE is back with new lightning talks after the pandemic interruption.</p>

<p>Every first Tuesday of the month (in theory), the LSE organises
lightning talks. A lightning talk takes between 15 and 20 minutes
and is a short perspective about a subject members have found
interesting.</p>

    <p>To cache or not to cache, making pkg_add faster (Marc Espie) <a href="/data/lt/2022-06-07/lt-2022-06-07-marc-espie-pkg_add.pdf">slides</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/aUuQ07jj9mU">video</a></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>There are lots of factors for designing a package distribution system: reliability, footprint, and speed. As for footprint, the strategy has always been: grab as little as we can, and decide to update or not. We’ve long resisted adding caching, because it’s so easy to get out-of-whack, and also because this would require supplementary tools in the base system,leading to a chicken&amp;egg problem. This talk is about the fairly low-tech approach to caching  I finally tried, the “too good to be true” speed-up,  and all the devillish details before it went into production.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Spectre and meltdown attacks are widely known exploits based on branch prediction mechanisms. Despite their wide media coverage, their internal behavior remains obscure for most people. We investigate the behavior of branch predictors to further understand such attacks and their scope. Finally we present a famous software mitigation technique and its impacts.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The exokernel operating system architecture, proposed in 1995, addresses the performance limits of traditional operating systems’ abstractions. It exports hardware resources allowing applications to use any abstraction through libraries. We will take a look at the exokernel design and how some operating systems’ abstractions evolved to reduce the performance limits.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Classic public key cryptography relies on the generation of large prime numbers. However, deterministic prime testing is untractable, so probabilistic tests are used instead. We investigate a class of pseudo-primes based on Carmichael numbers that fool common tests, and thus can be used adversarially to break crypto-systems, along with a comparatively newer probabilistic test that’s harder to fool.</p>

      <p>Microkernel is a well-known kernel design combining modularity, minimalism, and robustness.

    <blockquote>
      <p>Course material building is a difficult step in teaching as it requires combination of documents (extraction of main subjects and analysis of the order of chapters).
CREA method aims at helping teachers by: 1) showing them relevancy of documents, and main topics to teach or explain 2) proposing sessions based on clusters of terms that are linked together in the existing documents 3) ordering those clusters of terms for presenting a complete syllabus. This method is still under development but show interesting results concerning the two first targets.</p>

    <p>OpenBSD: Can I haz debug ? (Marc Espie) <a href="/data/lt/2019-12-10/lt-2019-12-10-marc-espie-debug.pdf">slides</a></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Compared to the base system, the OpenBSD package framework is huge, and takes hours and hours to build, thus leading to not so accurate bug-reports.
However, including debug information everywhere by default is not an option, due to the sheer size of the files. During p2k19, Paul Irofti and I designed some glue to create debug packages in a more or less automated fashion.
This is a story of agile development, as it took just a few days from the initial draft to V4 of the framework, and we can now produce debug packages for most relevant ports.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Unit testing should be a mandatory step in most of projects. Unit tests should be easy to write and easy to launch. Yet, writing unit tests for Hardware Description Languages (Verilog, VHDL, Migen…) can be quite cumbersome.
Migen is a Python library for hardware description. We will see how to take advantage of the expressivity given by Python for generating test modules dynamically.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Boolean Satisfiability (or SAT) problem is the problem of finding if a set of Boolean values that satisfies a given Boolean formula exists. SAT, even if it is the first problem proven NP-complete, is used in fields like circuit design and automatic theorem proving.
The algorithm used to solve SAT problems is arborescent but the most time consuming operation used in it, the Boolean Constraint Propagation (BCP), is a good target for hardware acceleration.
Based on the work of John D. Davis and Jason Thong, let’s explore two possible BCP co-processor designs on FPGA.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This starts with an interesting use-case for sqlite, based on the need to collate metadata about 10000+ distinct ports on OpenBSD, an obvious use of relational database technology.
However, designing a database schema for human consumption is tricky, between the desire of having human-readable views or table, and the need to have a sensible database schema with internal consistency.
This is the tale of a pseudo ORM designed for human readability, as an exercise in futility, because “why not ?”</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Intel introduced a hardening mitigation for SMM called SMM_CODE_CHK_EN. This mitigation prevents a processor in SMM mode from executing code outside the protected memory defined for SMM, the same way than SMEP prevents the kernel to execute userland code.

    <p>Dumping C/C++ structures, the return ! (Paul Semel)</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>C/C++ programmers often need to dump the content of their structures. As one can’t have structures information at runtime, it’s not possible to write a generic structure pretty printer. <br /> The first attempt we made consisted of reading debugging information located in the ELF file; this was not a good idea.  Hopefuly, those information are known at compile time, so let’s implement a CLang structure pretty printing built-in.</p>
